    # This test is currently lying to me. It's telling me everything works, but
      # b/c I'm a dumbass, and async code is hard, at least the qunit version did
      # not wrongfully pass, b/c it expected 2. To accurately test this like it is
      # I either need to use a spy or setup a strange setTimeout up like in the
      # 2nd test, but that then goes back to testing time explicitly. Am I missing
      # something or is qunit just easier to use?
